        <div class="default-text-wrapper"><h2>Submitting a Character</h2>
         To create characters here at Underwood, you submit their bio to their Clan roster:

         <h3 style="float: left;"> <img style="float: left; width: 30px; margin-right: 5px; margin-top: -5px;" src="images/pinecone.png"/> RavineClan:</h3> <a style="float: left; margin-left: 10px;" class="channel-link" href="#">rc-roster</a>
         <div style="float:none; clear:both;"></div>
         <h3 style="float: left;"> <img style="float: left; width: 30px; margin-right: 5px; margin-top: -5px;" src="images/leaf.png"/> Outsiders:</h3> <a style="float: left; margin-left: 10px;" class="channel-link" href="#">hc-roster</a>

         <b>Your character must be approved by staff before you can post with them</b>, to make sure they're realistic given the traditional setting of the world, and also that they fit in with existing history. This is a painless process though and how you write your bio aside from a few requirements is up to you.

         In the spirit of keeping things simple, <u>there is no minimum word count for bios</u>. We just ask that you provide a good baseline of information about your character.

         If you'd like to plan out your character in advance with others, feel free to head to ‚Å†<a class="channel-link2" href="#"># plotting</a> first. You're very welcome to plot your characters ahead of time to see how they might fit into things and so you can backwrite their history.

         You can also check out <a class="channel-link2" href="#"># adoptions</a> if you want to apply for a character with a pre-existing plot or relations.
        </div>

        <div class="default-text-wrapper"><h2>Character Rules</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>For now, <b>you can have a maximum of 3Ô∏è‚É£ characters.</b></li>
            <li><b>Only one character can start as a city cat.</b> We intend to expand this limit but at a later stage of the plot.</li>
            <li><b>All characters are real-timed ‚åõ except for kits</b>, which are double-timed until apprentice age (aged two moons for every one IRL month, until they are six moons old).</li>
            <li>If you decide to archive a character to add a new one, be aware your archived character will be removed permanently from roleplay, and won't be able to be posted with again unless you ask staff for a special exception.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="default-text-wrapper"><h2>Character Bio Setup</h2>
          We have a basic character bio template to use when submitting characters! You are welcome to modify/add additional sections, so long as the base information already specified is kept in some form. Please only post your bio when it is ready to be submitted.

          <ol>
            <li>Start by making a new thread in <a class="channel-link2" href="#">rc rooster</a> or <a class="channel-link2" href="#">hc-roster</a>. Title it with your character's name and add the <code>!pending</code> tag.</li>
            <li>Add your character image to your thread first and send it. Don't add any text yet‚Äîthis will ensure the image is at the top of your thread.</li>
            <li>Add your character information to the thread, using the code provided below.</li>
            <li>Submit the bio for review by tagging staff in the thread when you are finished.</li>
        </ol>
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you keep a back up of your bio locally on your computer - if you accidentally delete any of it permanently, staff might not be able to recover it for you.

        We also have an archived tag for if a character is killed, leaves, or is otherwise missing in action. Staff may also add this tag if a character falls inactive for a long period of time or when a member leaves the server. To request it added, tag staff in your characters bio and ask.
        </div>

        <div class="default-text-wrapper"><h2>BIO CODE</h2>
          Because individual discord messages are capped at 2000 characters (roughly 300 words), <b>we recommend splitting each section of bio code out into their own messages.</b>

          ‚ö†Ô∏èÔªø <b>Important:</b> Don't remove the <code>_ _</code> at the beginning of sections. These add the line break between each section.

          <h3>IMAGE</h3>Post this first!
          <div class="multi-code">url here
          </div>
          <h3>üìã GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
          <div class="multi-code"># CHARACTER NAME

          **Name:**
          **Rank:**
          **Gender:**
          **Age:**
          </div>

          <div class="multi-code">_ _
          ## ¬ª PERSONALITY

          Personality description here.
          </div>
            <h3>üìö  HISTORY</h3>

          ## ¬ª HISTORY

          - History event one.
          - History event two.
          </div>
          ‚ùï If you run out of room in single message for all of your text for one part of your bio, you can finish that paragraph wherever it falls under the character limit, and then start your next paragraph in a new message like so:

          <div class="multi-code">_ _
          Next paragraph here.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="default-text-wrapper"><h2>BIO IMAGE</h2>
          There are some things to know when posting images to discord:

          <ul>
            <li>Firstly, the maximum width an image uploaded directly will display at on large screens is <b>550px</b>.</li>
            <li>If an image is linked üîó via URL, this then shrinks to <b>400px</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          The latter is the only way you can update your image later if you decide to (simply edit the message and replace the old link üîó with a new one). In both instances, the image will still be its full resolution when opened, but will display in discord at only these sizes.

          It's up to you if you want to upload a new image directly to your bio and then repost your bio text underneath it, or use the URL update method.

          We recommend the latter, for ease and to avoid losing parts of your bio.
